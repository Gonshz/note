## Client Side Rendering vs Server Side Rendering
From [batify](https://www.botify.com/blog/client-side-server-side-rendering-seo)
### Client Side Rendering
Server just send codes and clients build it from original codes.
*Pros*
1. Loading is fast (Client just receive codes).
2. Easier to build than server side rendering.
*Cons*
1. Poor user experience due to Javascript loading time length and burden of its functions.
2. Search engine bots do not crawl the Javascript contents (Bad for SEO score).
### Server Side Rendering
Server renders the website (Server build website and send it).
*Pros*
1. Clients and search engine bots get a faster page experience.
*Cons*
1. Burden of the server is high.
2. It tends not to work with third-party Javascript.

Server Side Rendering is better for SEO than Client Side Rendering. But there is a better option: Dynamic rendering.
